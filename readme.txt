                        Blank Theme Reloaded
                        --------------------
               (aka Blank Theme 2: Electric Boogaloo)

This is Chris Coyiers "Blank" theme ported to WordPress 4.4 and updated
for 2016 by Lewis Collard and Steve Judge. From the original post in
2010 (https://digwp.com/2010/02/blank-wordpress-theme/):

 It is a WordPress theme with all the functionality of a typical WordPress
 theme but almost none of the styling. The idea is that when starting a new
 theme, it is far easier to use this as a base then a theme that is already
 finished and styled.

Steve and I loved this and we used Blank for every one of our projects, but it
quickly fell out of date. We spent a little time updating it, and Lewis is now
periodically releasing new versions to work with the latest WordPress. It
works on WordPress 4.4, with no warnings when WP_DEBUG is turned on, and gives
no errors in the latest Theme Check plugin (other than warning about a .git
directory).

The opinionated stuff:

* It pulls the latest 1.x version of jQuery from the Microsoft CDN (which is,
  suprisingly, the fastest one out there).
* The theme uses a Meyer CSS reset to remove all default browser styling.
* There are empty media queries for smaller devices.
* It uses HTML5 tags where appropriate.
* It has a vanishingly small number of default styles.
* The emoji junk introduced in 4.2 is removed (with thanks to Christine
  Cooper).

Other than that, there is only basic functionality and no styling. This is a
raw ingot, a blank for use in new theme development; this is of no interest to
non-developers.
