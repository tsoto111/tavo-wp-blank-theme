# { Tavo's | WP Blank Theme }

### Tavo's flavor of Chris Coyier's blank theme, updated for WordPress 4.4.

This theme was built off of Blank Theme Reloaded (aka Blank Theme Reloaded 2: Electric Boogaloo) authord by Chris Coyier, Lewis Collard, Steve Judge, and finally passed through my own hands. Everyone has their own flavor of a WordPress development environment and this is mine. Instead of having to re-setup the blank theme with my flavor every time, I have decided to open this repo.

Feel free to utilize my template for your own Wordpress Development sites both private or commercial. Just as I did with the Blank Theme Reloaded 2. As stated in Blank Theme Reloaded 2, "For a formal license statement, use the unlicense (http://unlicense.org/) in the file UNLICENSE."
